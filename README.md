# Zenchain-Bridge-simulator
Explore a static, multi-language UI for a ZenChain Token Bridge. This project demonstrates front-end concepts for blockchain interactions, including wallet simulation and diverse transfer methods.

## **ZenChain Token Bridge UI**

A simulated user interface for a token bridge, demonstrating multi-chain asset transfer concepts with a focus on user experience and localization.

-----

### **Overview**

This project presents a static, client-side user interface for a hypothetical **ZenChain Token Bridge**. It's built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to visually represent the core functionalities of a decentralized token bridge without actual blockchain integration.

-----

### **Features**

  * **Connect Wallet Simulation:** Simulate connecting and disconnecting a cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
  * **Multi-Chain Selection:** Dropdown menus for selecting "From Chain" (e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Polygon) and "To Chain" (ZenChain).
  * **Token Amount Input:** A field to specify the amount of ZTC (ZenChain Token) to bridge.
  * **Transfer Method Selection:** Radio buttons to choose between "Standard Transfer" and "Fast Transfer" (with simulated time/fee differences).
  * **Multi-Language Support:** Dynamic language switching for English, Persian (فارسی), Arabic (العربية), and Chinese (中文) to enhance user accessibility.
  * **Clean & Responsive UI:** A modern and user-friendly design that adapts well to different screen sizes.

-----

### **Technologies Used**

  * **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
  * **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
  * **JavaScript:** For interactive elements, form handling, and localization logic.
